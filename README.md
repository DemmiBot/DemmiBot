- 👋 Hi, I’m @DemmiBot
- 👀 I’m interested in ROCK (from Nu Metal to Power Metal), Games, voice-acting and, of course, computers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can further my knowledge of co-working and programming logic.
- 📫 If you're here you probably know me from somewhere else, in wich case, hello again!
